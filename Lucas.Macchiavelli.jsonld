    "motivations": "I’m motivated by the potential of Cardano to create lasting, positive change, particularly in my home country of Argentina, where economic instability and political challenges are significant. \n\nGrowing up in this environment has made me realize the urgent need for decentralized, transparent systems, and Cardano offers the ideal platform to drive that change. \n\nWith over three years of experience in promoting Cardano, I’ve seen firsthand how blockchain can empower individuals, businesses, and institutions by fostering economic inclusion and trust. \n\nI want to be a DRep to continue advocating for Cardano in both public and private sectors, engaging with leaders and innovators who can help scale its adoption. By leveraging my professional experience in marketing, business development, and community building, I’m committed to making Cardano a cornerstone of global blockchain adoption, driving meaningful impact in Latin America and beyond.",
    "objectives": "As a Cardano DRep, my goal is to drive exponential but sustainable growth for the Cardano ecosystem by addressing key challenges like the lack of structured business development, ineffective communication strategies, and limited funding. \n\nI aim to push for a clearer, more compelling narrative that showcases Cardano’s strengths, positioning it as a leader in decentralization, sustainability and security\n\nMy strategy involves professionalizing business development and forming strategic partnerships with governments, businesses, and NGOs, ensuring real-world adoption. I want to transform Cardano into a global brand, driving both investment and user engagement. \n\nUltimately, I envision Cardano as a major player in the decentralized technological revolution, offering long-term value for users and promoting an ecosystem built on trust, innovation, and economic inclusion.\n\nI go into full depth into this in my DRep Whitepaper at the end\n\n",

    "qualifications": "As a Cardano Ambassador, I've worked closely with key political figures and businesses, advocating for Cardano adoption in Argentina. One of my proudest achievements is co-organizing Argentina Digital Nation (ADN), an event that brought together over 500 participants, including Charles Hoskinson, to discuss blockchain's future in Argentina.\n\nI also co-founded Token Allies, a decentralized venture capital platform connecting businesses and investors on Cardano, and the LATAM Cardano Community, organizing events and workshops to promote Cardano throughout Latin America. \n\nWith over three years of experience, I've helped expand Cardano through strategic communications, business development, and community engagement. I’ve led efforts to craft Cardano’s narrative, forge strategic partnerships, and promote its real-world impact in sectors like education and government, driving sustainable growth and adoption across the region.",
